### What is it?

Responsive image grids are one of the most common features of modern websites. SpiceWheel makes it easy to rapidly prototype different styles of grids for your website. Here are some examples of image grids from Pinterest, Amazon, Unsplash and Banana Republic.
### Example Image Grids

### How does it work?

SpiceWheel is an opinionated library. If you want to use it, you need to do something that no modern front-end web developer has or will ever do (until now), use HTML tables. At SpiceWheel, we prefer to call these beautiful relics SpiceRacks.

Each row in a SpiceRack has information about an individual grid element. For SpiceWheel to interpret the SpiceRack correctly, the SpiceRack will need one column to hold the image that will be displayed, a label for the image, and optionally some additional information about the element.
